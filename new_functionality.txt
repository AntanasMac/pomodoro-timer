Functionality: websaitas issaugo ir gali parodyti istorija sekmingai pabaigtu pomodoro sessiju



Adding this functionality to your Pomodoro timer website is definitely achievable, even if you are just learning to program web.

Here are some steps you can follow to implement this feature:

Create a form on your website where users can enter their objective for the Pomodoro session. The form can include a text input field where the user can type their objective, and a button to submit the form.

When the user clicks the submit button, use JavaScript to capture the objective value from the input field and store it in a variable.

When the user clicks the start button to start the Pomodoro timer, use JavaScript to log a message to the console indicating that the timer has been started and also log the user's objective.

To allow the user to view their history of objectives, you can create a section on your website that displays a list of past objectives. Whenever a user completes a Pomodoro session, you can add their objective to the list.

You can use local storage or a backend database to persist the user's history of objectives across multiple sessions.

Here's some sample code to help you get started:
